If you are a new student to the smart campus energy lab, do not fret! We are a
mostly student run lab, and as such, support each other in our own endeavors. 
This lab is both software and hardware based, much much of the work will 
depend more on software.

SCEL is very closely coupled with the Renewable Island Energy Sustainability group.
